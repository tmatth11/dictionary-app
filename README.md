# Dictionary App

![Dictionary App Cover Photo](image.png)

Dictionaries are a great way to learn new words and expand your vocabulary. This simple web application written using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows you to do just that. All you have to do is search for your desired word, and it will display the definition, part of speech, pronunciation, and example sentence (if applicable). The user can also press the speaker button to hear the word pronounced. The <a href="https://dictionaryapi.dev/" target="_blank">Free Dictionary API</a> is used to fetch the definitions. Each new word is added to the top of the page and can be removed by clicking the "Remove" button. The words are saved locally in the browser and will persist even after the page is closed.
